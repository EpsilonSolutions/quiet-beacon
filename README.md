[Quiet Beacon](https://github.com/quiet/quiet-beacon/)
===========

Low-powered beacon transmitter/receiver which can be used either on its own or in addition to [libquiet](https://github.com/quiet/quiet/). The transmitter creates a simple sine tone at a specified frequency, and the receiver uses the Goertzel Algorithm to detect the presence of the tone with complexity O(n) for n samples.
